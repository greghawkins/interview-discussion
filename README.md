# interview-discussion

1 Work done:
- I have completed the task 100% in line with the requirements in the original Readme file
- I have implemented the 2-for-1 functionality as requested. However, I was unsure how you required me to implement if they qualified for multiple 2-for-1 deals. The way I implemented this was; if they buy 7 DVDs, then they get three 2-for-1 deals (Displayed as "2 FOR 1 (x3) -Â£45.00")

2 There were a couple bugs in CliTest which I have fixed:
- The way the thursday/notThursday logic was implemented was not quite right (the while loop ran infinitely)
- The testDiscount2For1OnThursdays() the expected grand-total in the test was incorrect (if you add up the numbers is outputs you'll see it's incorrect)

3 I have pushed up 2 commits:
- Original without my changes (commit 1)
- My changes (commit 2)
- This should help you examine all changes more easily
